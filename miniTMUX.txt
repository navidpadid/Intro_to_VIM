So here is an intro for TMUX too!

Many TMUX shortcuts are like:
	ctrl + B | or +  ....
	| means to pause after the previous combination
	
Some combinations:
	ctrl + b | ? => some keyboard shortcuts
	ctrl + b | % => split vertically
	ctrl + b | " => split horizontally
	ctrl + b | ArrowKeys => for switching panes
	ctrl + b + ArrowKeys => for resizing panes
	ctrl + b | z => for focusing/unfocusing on the current pane
	ctrl + b | t => for showing time in the pane
	ctrl + b | 0,1,...,n => switch between windows
	ctrl + b | c => create new tmux window
	ctrl + b | d => detach from session
	ctrl + b | PageUP => for going up in the output (for long outputs of a command)	
		q => to quit this browsing mode	
		ctrl + s => to search in this mode		

TMUX for session attachment:
	tmux ls => show active sessions
	tmux attach -t 0,1,...,n => attach to a session (you can use name of a session instead of number)
	tmux new -s NAVID => create new session named NAVID		 

For synchronizing the input of all panes:
	ctrl + b | :
		setw synchronize-panes on => all panes have the synchronized input
		setw synchronize-panes off => non-synchronize

To enabile 256 color mode in TMUX (useful in VIM):
	tmux -2 ....
